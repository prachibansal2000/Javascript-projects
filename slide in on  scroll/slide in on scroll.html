      <h3>What is tsunami?</h3>
      <p>
        Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions
        under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not
        dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they
        build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean
        decreases. The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than
        the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may travel as
        fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching
        shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves,
        this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to
        do with these giant waves.<img

      <h3>What causes tsunami?</h3>
      <p>
        These awe-inspiring waves are typically caused by large, undersea
        earthquakes at tectonic plate boundaries. When the ocean floor at a
        plate boundary rises or falls suddenly, it displaces the water above it
        and launches the rolling waves that will become a tsunami. Most
        tsunamis–about 80 percent–happen within the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of
        Fire,” a geologically active area where tectonic shifts make volcanoes
        and earthquakes common.<br />

      <h3>What happens when it hits land?</h3>
      <p>
        A tsunami’s trough, the low point beneath the wave’s crest, often
        reaches shore first. When it does, it produces a vacuum effect that
        sucks coastal water seaward and exposes harbor and sea floors. This
        retreating of sea water is an important warning sign of a tsunami,
        because the wave’s crest and its enormous volume of water typically hit
        shore five minutes or so later. Recognizing this phenomenon can save
        lives.<br />
